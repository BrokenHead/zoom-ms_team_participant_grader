## Why / how's it working
as seminar and classroom that have participant and have to separate(pass or not pass) participant by percent of attendance working on MS team log or zoom meeting log

- program will summarize participant's attendance time no matter how many times leave and re-join
- will get (attendance time : all of activities time) as percent and grading who's pass activities from input
